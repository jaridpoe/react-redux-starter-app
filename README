This simple project includes React, Redux, Selectors, and Webpack.
It can be used as a starters kit or simply demonstrate how Redux and Selectors work with React.


How to set up the project:

#1 Install Node Packages by running 'npm install' (on the root directory where package.json is).


#2 To run development mode: type 'npm start -s'
Development includes hot reloading and other helpful development tools.


#3 To run production mode: type 'npm run build -s'
Production will remove hot reloading, minifies javascript, and other optimizations.



Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
