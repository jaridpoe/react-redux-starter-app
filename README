This simple project includes React, Redux, Selectors, and Webpack.
It can be used as a starters kit or simply demonstrate how Redux and Selectors work with React.


How to set up the project:

#1 Install Node Packages by running 'npm install' (on the root directory where package.json is).


#2 To run development mode: type 'npm run dev'
Development includes hot reloading and other helpful development tools.


#3 To run production mode: type 'npm run build'
Production will remove hot reloading, minifies javascript, and other optimizations.
